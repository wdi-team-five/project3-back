# project3-back

Link to front end repo: https://github.com/wdi-team-five/project3-front

The back end of our project is hosted on heroku. we used MongoDB and a PostgreSQL database.

We used Node.js and Express to create the back end of our project. We had different tables for User, Profile, and an Element join table that joins UserId to MongoId.

As we continue working on this website we want to continue to add more functions such as the ability to share with other users and set different permissions.

Attached below is the link to our ERD.
